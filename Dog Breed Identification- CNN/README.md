# Convolutional Neural Network - Dog Breed Idenfication
## Project Overview

In this project, I built a deep learning pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, it will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I made important design decisions about the user experience for your app.  Also in the process of completing this project, I understood the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  Hopefully my imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!
